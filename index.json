	"content": "Why should I learn Python? Python has been around for nearly 30 years and is still rising in popularity because of some \u0026ldquo;new\u0026rdquo; popular usage (Cloud, data science, machine learning\u0026hellip;) and because Python is a really popular first language thanks to his accessibility and quick learning curve.\nRemember language is just a tool and your skill will translate to any new language. It\u0026rsquo;s like learning to drive: once you know how to drive, you can drive any car, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t know where the buttons are, you\u0026rsquo;ll always be able to go somewhere with it.\nHow to Practice Python You\u0026rsquo;ve got to practice python in order only if you are not experience in Python. Each chapter assumes that you\u0026rsquo;ve practice the previous ones.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s in this Practice Python? Learning syntax of any programming language is not enough, you can learn many language but if you don\u0026rsquo;t develop problem solving skills then its all useless. That\u0026rsquo;s why this practice/course is combination of data structure and algorithms with Python 3. So if you don\u0026rsquo;t know anything about any programming language then you can start from Beginning.\n"
